;;; Commentary:

;; See the Spacemacs documentation and FAQs for instructions on how to implement
;; a new layer:
;;
;;   SPC h SPC layers RET
;;
;;
;; Briefly, each package to be installed or configured by this layer should be
;; added to `irony-packages'. Then, for each package PACKAGE:
;;
;; - If PACKAGE is not referenced by any other Spacemacs layer, define a
;;   function `irony/init-PACKAGE' to load and initialize the package.

;; - Otherwise, PACKAGE is already referenced by another Spacemacs layer, so
;;   define the functions `irony/pre-init-PACKAGE' and/or
;;   `irony/post-init-PACKAGE' to customize the package as it is loaded.

;;; Code:


(defconst irony-packages
'(irony
  company-irony
  flycheck-irony)
)

(setq irony-mode-excluded-packages
      '(auto-complete-clang))

(defun irony/init-irony ()
  (use-package irony
    :defer t
    :init
    (progn
      (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
      (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
